Double jump mod for [Hue](https://www.huethegame.com/). Simply adds a double jump. Nothing more, nothing less.

# Compatibility

**Compatible with**

* Level Loader
* Debug Mod
* Randomiser

**Not compatible with**

* 

Note: In general, this mod's compatibility is only limited by the fact that it overrides the StaticUpdate() method of PlayerNew, so it will not be compatible with any other mod that also overrides that method.
